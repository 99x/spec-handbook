Hypothesis Invalidation
=======================

## HI.1.1 

Team is equipped with a wireframing/prototyping tool. Prototypes can be shared, modified and discussed easily in a group context (preferably including end users).


## HI.2.1 

Assumptions upon the major feature success depends are identified. Implementation plan is made to test these hypotheses through progressive MVPs.


## HI.3.1 

Important features will be accompanied with the expected usage estimations. Methods for measuring feature usage/effectiveness are a part of the feature spec itself.


## HI.3.2 

Team is able to perform split tests, feature fakes, etc. to gain better insight in to real user preferences through statistical means.
