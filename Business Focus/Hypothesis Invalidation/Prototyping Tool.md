# Use a Prototyping Tool

Team is equipped with a wireframing/prototyping tool. Prototypes can be shared, modified and discussed easily in a group context (preferably including end users).

## Implementation - 01

### Tools
- [invision](https://www.invisionapp.com)

### How?
- Create an account in invision and invite the team members
- After creating an account, team members can collaboratively build and validate prototypes.
- Created prototypes can be validated from peers / users and also invision supports 
in-app communication (chat/comments) to get better feedback

### Result 
![create-new-prototype](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2338919/50735199-dec78c00-11d0-11e9-8ac8-378944fce633.gif)

### Challenges
- Free tier in Invision only offers users 1 prototype to test drive with unlimited screens and collaborators, for an unlimited period of time.
