Demonstrations to the stakeholders are carried out in a systematic manner with the records of the demo available.


## FD.2.1 

Deployment to staging is done at every iteration and demonstrations are carried out only through staging environments.

Production deployments are repeatedly done (in an agreed interval) to keep the platform up to date, even if there is no market demand for new feature releases.


## FD.3.2 

Releases are decoupled from deployments. Features can be dark launched using feature toggles.


## FD.3.3
