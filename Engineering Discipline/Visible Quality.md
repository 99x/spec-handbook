=============== 

## VQ.1.1 

A unit testing framework is integrated to the solution. Team has the ability of test execution at least upon build time.


## VQ.1.2 

Code quality is analyzed automatically at the development environment (IDE). A common ruleset used for analysis is shared across the team members.


## VQ.1.3

Team understands the test-pyramid roles played by different test types . Tooling and infrastructure for the same is agreed and is being built.



## VQ.2.1

## VQ.2.2 

Continuous Integration is in place and tests are automatically executed upon builds. Commits are stopped if a test/build is broken, until fixed.


## VQ.2.3 

Central code quality analysis tool is integrated to monitor continuously. Overall quality indicators follow upward trend during current quarter.



## VQ.3.1 

Team is aware and practices of TDD in developing new code modules. All new code written is testable with proper dependency handling techniques.


## VQ.3.2

Acceptance tests for new features are automated and maintained as a regression test suite. Coverage levels are incrementing over time.
